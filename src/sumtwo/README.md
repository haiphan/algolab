We are given an ordered array and a value. We’re then asked to create a function which returns true or false.

In other words, are there any two integers, x and y , in our array that — when added — are equal to our specified value?

If we were given the array [1, 2, 4, 9] and the value 8 , our function should return false , because no two values in the array may be added together to get 8

if we were given the array [1, 2, 4, 4] and the value 8 , our function should return true , because 4 + 4 = 8
