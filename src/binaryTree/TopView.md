Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. Given a binary tree, print the top view of it. The output nodes can be printed in any order. Expected time complexity is O(n).

```sh
       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    / \
 4    5  6   7
```
Top view of the above binary tree is
4 2 1 3 7

```sh
        1
      /   \
    2       3
      \

          \
            5
             \
               6
```
Top view of the above binary tree is
2 1 3 6
